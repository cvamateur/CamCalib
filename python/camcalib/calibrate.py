    #         K_inv * h1 = r1
    #         K_inv * h2 = r2
    #         K_inv * h3 = t
    #     Since r1, r2 stem from a rotation matrix, we exploit properties:
    #         r1^T * r2 = 0
    #         |r1| = |r2| = 1 -> r1^T * r1 - r2^T * r2 = 0

    #         h1^T * K_inv^T * K_inv * h1 - h2^T * K_inv^T * K_inv * h2 = 0
    #     To simplify the equations, we define a symmetric and positive
    #     definite matrix B = K_inv^T * K_inv, such that:
    #         h1^T * B * h2 = 0
    #         h1^T * B * h1 - h2^T * B * h2 = 0
